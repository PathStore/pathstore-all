1:
	Create some sort of custom file implementation (JSON, XML, YAML, ...) that allows for defining the network structure. 
	It needs the folowing attributes (Parent Node IP address (NONE if root), Cassandra IP address and port number (Allows for external cassandra ring), SSH Username and password for setup, Role of node (TBD)). 
	This can also be extended to allow for default configuration of cassandra server so no setup on the users end is required. 
	With the condition that the user account has sudo and or the required cassandra version is installed.
2:
	Create a script or simple program (C, C++, Python, Go, Bash) to interpret this file format and create the network top down (ROOT -> EDGE).
3:
	Edit the program to auto create the path store properties file. (This may need to be done in JAVA as java allows for easy property file creation)
4:
	Extend the program to create additional nodes. (TBD: Allowing for complete network restructuring or just allowing to create new child nodes).
	If we want to allow for complete network restructuring then we most likely will need to update pathstore to allow for dymanic configuration updates during the running process.
5:
	Extend the program to update the file based on your changes.
6:
	Handle failures. I.E if one of the ssh user/pass is incorrect we need to UNDO all the previous operations and or prompt the user to correct their configuration mistake.
7:
	Create a CLI application that makes this easier then running multiple different programs to do multiple different operations. I.E all operations in a singular program. (Basic setup and adding nodes / restructuring network topology)
